```html 
<a href="{{ url_for('your_page_name') }}">button_name</a>

in my case this is the password.

### üìíNote: Dont forgot to make step1.

#### Step 2: To start this project using docker
```bash 
docker-compose up --build
```
#### Note : Before build make sure postgreSQL is installed in you docker and then build and start the server.
#### Step 3:To watch the data in database
- Check wheather the postgres is running or not in docker using this command
```bash 
docker ps
```
- you will see the postgresql db is running
```bash 
docker exec -i your_container_name psql -U user_name -d database_name -c "\dt"
```
- In our case
    Container name is ```postgres_db```.
    User name is ```postgres```.
    Database name is ```users_db```.
-
+ It will list the tables created.
+ Go into the table created for user credientials 
+ Run this command in cmd
```bash 
"SELECT * FROM your_table_name;
```
In our case table name is ```users```

- Now you can watch the data stored in the databse.
- To delete ```all the data``` in the Database run this command
```bash
DELETE FROM users;
```
- To delete ```Specific row data``` in database
```bash
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```
- Change the id = which row you want to delete.
- Run this command to exit
```bash
\q
```
